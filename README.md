# 🧮 Advanced Calculator with Number System Conversions

## 📌 Overview
This is a fully functional **web-based calculator** that not only performs standard arithmetic operations but also provides additional functionality for **number system conversions** and **factorial calculations**. The design features an intuitive UI with a modern look, thanks to **CSS styling and animations**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
- ✅ **Decimal to Binary Conversion**: Converts a decimal number into its binary equivalent.
- ✅ **Binary to Octal Conversion**: Converts a binary number into an octal number.
- ✅ **Binary to Gray Code Conversion**: Converts a binary number into its Gray code representation.
- ✅ **Factorial Calculation**: Computes the factorial of a given number.
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Styled with **CSS (linear gradient, box shadows, animations)** for an interactive and modern look.
- ✅ **Smooth Hover Effects**: Buttons scale up slightly when hovered over, enhancing the UI experience.

## 🎨 UI and Styling
- **Dark theme with a gradient background** for a sleek appearance.
- **Button animations** for better interactivity.
- **Properly aligned grid layout** for easy accessibility of buttons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the calculator layout.
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, and responsiveness (see [`calc.css`](calc.css)).
- **JavaScript**: Implementing calculator logic, arithmetic operations, and conversions.
